An interaction and fun bot for Telegram groups, having some useful and other useless commands.

# Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- A Linux distribution (should also work on Windows but has not been tested correctly)

# Setup

- Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/AmanoTeam/PyKorone`
- Go to https://my.telegram.org/apps and create a new app to get your API ID and API HASH.
- Now create a copy of the `config.py.example` file with the command 'cp config.py.example config.py'
- Finally fill in all the required fields in the `config.py` (you can see everything well explained in the `config.py.example` file)
- Now to run the bot use `python3 bot.py`

# Special thanks

- [@usernein](https://github.com/usernein) - contributed with teachings, ideas and allowed me to use some of his codes.
- [@AndrielFR](https://github.com/AndrielFR) - one of the main developers of the bot, who helped me in great things, was he who created the 'gban.py' and among other things.
